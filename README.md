This project aims to allow students to quickly identify subjects that they are good in and bad in.
Resulting in a quick fast and easy  way to understand where to improve and what they don't need to worry about.
It also helps teachers in taking less time consulting plenty of students allowing them to have more meaningful and less time consuming conversations with students.
